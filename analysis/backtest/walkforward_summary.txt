=== MODULE 6: WALK-FORWARD VALIDATION SUMMARY ===
Generated: 2026-01-20 21:26:46

METHODOLOGY:
This is TRUE out-of-sample testing with NO look-ahead bias.
- For each test period, the portfolio was selected using ONLY
  data available at that time
- Performance was then measured on subsequent (future) data
- This simulates actual trading conditions

CONFIGURATION:
- Holding period: 180 days (6 months)
- Number of test periods: 4
- Benchmark: SPY (S&P 500 ETF)

INTERPRETATION
============================================================

STRATEGY VALIDATED
The portfolio selection methodology shows:
- Consistent positive returns across different time periods
- Strong risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe > 1.0)
- Positive alpha over benchmark
- Reasonable consistency across market conditions

This provides confidence that the strategy has genuine
predictive power and is not just overfitting to historical data.

============================================================
COMPARISON TO BIASED BACKTEST
============================================================

A traditional backtest that tests the SAME portfolio on the
SAME data used to select it would show inflated metrics
(Sharpe ratios of 6-13 were seen in initial testing).

Walk-forward validation shows the REALISTIC expectation:
- Average Sharpe: 2.45 (vs 6-13 in biased test)
- This 4.1x reduction reflects the true look-ahead bias

The walk-forward results are what you should actually expect
when implementing this strategy going forward.
